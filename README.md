## Description
GLOWMAN DAN needs an e-commerce website that is viewable on both mobile and desktop browsers. With this, we are proposing to provide the client with services for its E-Commerce Web Design project. The company will create a basic website design and add user management, order placement, and feedback features to the website. Through this e-commerce website, the client will be able to provide customers with a convenient online shopping experience.
